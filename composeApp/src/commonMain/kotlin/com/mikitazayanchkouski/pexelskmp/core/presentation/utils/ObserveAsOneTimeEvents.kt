/** This function is needed to not lose any events,
 * that are arriving to our screen from the ViewModel.
 *
 * Theoretically it could happen, that if an event (for example about an error,
 * or about some successful action etc.) arrives during the configuration change
 * (during screen rotation, or theme switching, or locale, etc.) - then,
 * without this utility function, an event will be lost.
 *
 * This function prevents situations like these.
 *
 * P.S. We mainly need this function for the Android side, because on Ios,
 * or on Desktop, there is no such thing, as a configuration change.
